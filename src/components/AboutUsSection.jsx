        The Sonorous Youth is a non-profit youth-led social organization
        established in 2020 with the motive of Youth Empowerment by engaging the
        youths from all around the world in different self-development programs.
        It commenced as a Platform for a Public Speaking Competition during the
        COVID 19 Pandemic Situation. Behind this organization is a group of
        young minds from around the world! After the success of our first Global
        Public Speaking Competition, the Sonorous Youth sees a great potential
        to enlarge our Organization to contribute to various fields of Youth
        Empowerment, by coming up with multiple programs focusing on skills
        development and education!
